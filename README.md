# cartel-damages-inference

This repository contains code to conduct statistical inference in cartel damages estimation. It will be updated to include a Stata .do file which approximates the standard error of total damages from a fixed effects panel data model, using the delta method. Later, it may be updated to include an approximation via bootstrapping.
